# Modifying page rank

I want the changelog entries to be in the search results, but I want them
at the end.  It appears that to do this I need to "penalize" them in the
ranking. I am trying to do this by using an [external data source](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/guides/enriching-extraction-with-external-data/).  Also see this google sheets [example](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/guides/enriching-extraction-with-external-data/how-to/expose-google-spreadsheet-as-csv/) 

## Spreadsheet

I am sure that I could create a CSV file and pop it on the web anywhere
and I will likely put the file in a github repo and use the `raw` URL.
For now, here is the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlJzci7pQj_KznVHZxPSQH3MP2VbnmKmMzmW7UNGS1A/edit#gid=0)

## Exported CSV file

From a Google Sheet, click on **File > Share > Publish to the web**, and
then choose Entire Sheet and CSV File.
